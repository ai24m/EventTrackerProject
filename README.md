# EventTrackerProject üåê

## Overview
The More Practice, Algorithm Practice application was designed to track the performance of studious developers, or fresh graduates from a Coding Bootcamp, on their algorithmic questions skills. Furthermore, the format of the questions are designed to be answered in multiple programming languages of the users choice. Users are able to track their performance on one or multiple algorithm questions and update as they please. Sample solutions are provided by the admin. At of courtesy, sample solutions were sampled from various websites online for the purpose of illustrations for the project.

The end goal of the EventTrackerProject was to become more comfortable creating JPA projects joined with Spring Boot apps to publish a working REST API (Application Programming Interface) via the web. The first phase consisted of configuring the database with MySQL workbench, mapping the entities and testing within the JPA, creating the controller logic with basic CRUD operators using Spring Data JPA repository and service, and finally testing the REST API routes with Postman before deployment. The second phase was the implementation of HTML and JavaScript, where scripts were added to a web application and asynchronous requests were sent to Java controllers with JavaScript's XMLHttpRequest Consume and JSON responses to POST/PUT/DELETE functions.
